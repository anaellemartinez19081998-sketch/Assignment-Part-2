                    <s>Beside that,  there were <num>2</num>,<num>3</num> remarks which got mixed up in your last letter.</s>
                    <s><seg type="paradox">These remarks made me happy, but only despairingly so</seg>, since although what you say about <mentioned>the fear</mentioned> is very persuasive—to mind, heart, and body all at once—I have an even deeper conviction—I don't know exactly where—which evidently nothing can persuade.</s>
                    <s>Finally-this really contributed to weaken me—the wonderful calming-uncalming effect left by your physical presence is wearing off as the days go by.</s>

                    <s><seg type="realization">Moreover, it is partly explained by the fact that it constantly forces me to realize I must admit—and this is a great confession—that <persName ref="#milena">Milena</persName>, too, is only human.</seg></s>
                    <s>What you say about this is really very beautiful and kind—having heard that I wouldn't want to hear anything else; nevertheless, to maintain that the stakes here are not very high is a very questionable assertion.</s>
                    <s><seg type="universalisation">After all, this <mentioned>fear</mentioned> is not merely my private <mentioned>fear</mentioned>—although it also is, terribly enough—but it is also <mentioned>the fear</mentioned> inherent in all faith since time began.</seg></s>
