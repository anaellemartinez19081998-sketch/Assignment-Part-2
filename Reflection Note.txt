Similarities

My assignment 1 DTD and TEI_all share core structural approaches. Both use the same teiHeader, especially since I was inspired by the TEI guidelines when I made my DTD. I had already understood that letters require elements for sender/receiver dynamics and the dating conventions. The basic architecture is almost identical. 

Differences

The most significant difference I’ve seen in this assignment is the analytical granularity. My DTD allowed only allowed basic semantic markup. I had no mechanism for the interpretive work approach that I used for this Part 2. Reviewing my DTD now, I realize I had designed it just for the structure without any depth 
TEI_all provided the element ‘seg’ with flexible @type attributes which I used throught the three samples. This allowed me to encode interpretive categories. However, I must highlight that this flexibility seems to me double-edged: attributes like @type, @ana, and @seg accept any value without controlled vocabularies. Unlike my DTD’s strict values, TEI_all doesn’t constrain interpretive categories. This openness allows more nuanced analysis but I find myself uncertain whether my analytical terms are ‘correct’ or follow appropriate conventions. 

What I couldn’t Encode

Without ‘seg’, sentence boundaries, or ‘mentionned’ I couldn’t perform close reading through markup. My DTD completely lacked analytical support. 

Key Learning

I’ve learned that TEI_all really suited interpretation, but that freedom could pose problems if too interpretative. But also, there is multiple ways to structure with TEI_all depending on the goal of the encoding project.
