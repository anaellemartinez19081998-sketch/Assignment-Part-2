Similarities

My assignment 1 DTD and TEI_all share core structural approaches. Both use the same teiHeader, especially since I was inspired by the TEI guidelines when I made my DTD. I had already understood that letters require elements for sender/receiver dynamics and the dating conventions. The basic architecture is almost identical. 

Differences

1)The use of <seg> with flexible @type attributes.
I used it to encode interpretive categories (irony, paradox, biological determinism, etc.) across the three samples. Something my DTD simply could not express, since it had no element reserved for marking analytical layers in the text.

2)The possibility of adding analytical attributes such as @ana.
TEI_all helps me associate  interpretive information ( like marking scale, rhetorical function, thematic role) without altering the structural hierarchy. My DTD lacked any parallel mechanism for representing layered or overlapping analyses.

3)The ability to embed detailled components (e.g., <term>, <mentioned>, <name>, <placeName>, <pc>, etc.) within sentences.
TEI_all supports a extensive set of inline elements that enabled me to annotate concepts, entities, and discourse markers; in contrast, my DTD only defined broad structural units and prevented this level of detail.
This openness allows more nuanced analysis but I find myself uncertain whether my analytical terms are ‘correct’ or follow appropriate conventions. 


What I couldn’t Encode

One limitation I encountered is that TEI_all does not provide a dedicated mechanism for validating or standardising my interpretive categories.
I could assign labels such as biological_determinism, irony, paradox, or isolation through @type and @ana, but TEI_all does not restrict or define these values. Nothing prevents me from inventing inconsistent or ambiguous analytical terms, and the schema cannot warn me when two labels overlap, contradict each other, or belong to different analytical levels.

This matters for my project because I was explicitly trying to trace argumentative structure and rhetorical phenomena across texts. But without structure, it might seem messy and illogical between elements. 

Key Learning

I’ve learned that TEI_all really suited interpretation, but that freedom could pose problems if too interpretative. But also, there is multiple ways to structure with TEI_all depending on the goal of the encoding project.
