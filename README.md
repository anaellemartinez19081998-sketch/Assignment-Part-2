# Assignment-Part-2

Materials
I've selected three samples:

Franz Kafka's letter to Milena Jesenská (1920): A personal letter translated from German. This text allowed me to explore correspondence-specific TEI elements and how to analyze the text's patterns.

René Barjavel's La Faim du Tigre (1966): A philosophical essay excerpt examining human sexuality and animal instinct. This argumentative text provided opportunities to encode rhetorical structure and track how philosophical arguments develop and reverse.

Jean Anouilh's Antigone (1972): A confrontation (theatre) scene between Antigone and Créon. This theatrical text allowed me to try my hand at  dialogue markup and speech act analysis.

Approach
My approach prioritized experimentation with analytical encoding beyond basic structural markup. Rather than simply marking paragraphs and sentences, I focused on how TEI could capture interpretive readings of each text.
For Kafka, I broke the letter into sentence-level segments and tagged rhetorical devices (personification, paradox, isolation) to track how fear functions as a character throughout the text. For Barjavel, I encoded the three-phase argumentative structure establishing biological determinism, claiming human exceptionalism, then irony to explain how the author builds his own thesis. For Anouilh, I marked speech acts (imperatives, rhetorical questions, declarations) to demonstrate Antigone's linguistic dominance despite Créon's physical attempts at silencing.


AI Use Disclosure
I consulted AI assistance for clarification on several TEI elements: ‘gloss’, ‘keywords’, ‘ana’, ‘seg’, 'type', 'subtype' and ‘mentioned’. However, all encoding are entirely my own work.
